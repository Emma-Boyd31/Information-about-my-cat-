# How to take care of Teddy:
*   Feed him twice a day (mix one scoop of dry food with 1/2 a contianer of wet food for each feeding) 
*   Clean his litterbox at least twice a day, and take out the cat genie trashcan out once a week.
*   Make sure to play with him as often as possible.
*   Give him big ole belly rubs!
