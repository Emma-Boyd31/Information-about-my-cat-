# Teddy's First Vet Visit 

Teddy went to the vet on Tuesday, October 22nd. He got his first 
shot, and didn't even notice due to his consumption of spray cheese.
He also is being treated for three types of parasites. Which I am very
grossed out about. He acted like Ricky at the vet, and tried to take 
notes for the tech. Unfortunetly, he wrote that he was a good boy but
I think it got erased due to his bad behavior. Then the keyboard got
placed in a location not accessible to Ricky.

## Teddy's Next Visit to the Vet 

Teddy is scheduled to go back to the vet on Friday, November 22nd. 
Exactly a month after his last visit.
